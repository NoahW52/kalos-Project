# Welcome to the Kalos Project
Backend project 

## Empowering people to transform communities that change the world.

Purpose of this app: We are helping the wonderful people over at the Kalos Project to set up a functioning website that will further their reach in educating others on how to start their own journey into more sustainable farming.

Features: Those who visit will be introduced to a welcoming site with quick and easy access to knowledge of our mission and partners. Upon Registering for an account or logging in, the user will be able to access the information within our databases that will help to grow this start up. The ability to submit information of farmers interested in joining the cause, let the company itself know how you're interested and would like to get involved, as well as letting the team know of possible spots of farming land.
